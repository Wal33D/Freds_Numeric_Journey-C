# Fred's Numeric Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to **Fred's Numeric Journey**, a fun and interactive C project designed to explore the basics of variables, pointers, and memory addresses in C programming. Originally conceived as a university assignment by Waleed Gudah, this project has been repurposed into an engaging activity for learners and enthusiasts alike.

## ðŸ“– Introduction

In this project, you'll embark on an interactive journey with `fred`, a variable of type `double`. You will have the opportunity to assign `fred` a value, display it, and manipulate it using pointers. Additionally, you'll explore how to access and display the memory address of `fred` in both decimal and hexadecimal formats. This project is a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into the foundational concepts of C programming in a fun and accessible way.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Interactive introduction to variables and their values.
- Understanding and using pointers to manipulate data.
- Displaying memory addresses in different formats.
- Engaging user input to direct the journey.

## ðŸ›  Installation

### Prerequisites

To run **Fred's Numeric Journey**, you'll need:

- GCC Compiler or any compatible C compiler for your system.
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command-line interface.

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wal33D/Freds_Numeric_Journey-C.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Freds_Numeric_Journey-C
```

3. Compile the program using the provided Makefile. This step also creates a start script for easy execution of the program:

```bash
make
```

4. Run the program using the start script:

```bash
./startFredJourney.sh
```

## ðŸ“š How to Use

Simply follow the installation instructions to compile and run the program. The start script (`startFredJourney.sh`) simplifies execution, allowing you to easily embark on Fred's journey. Throughout the journey, `fred` will guide you, displaying his value, memory address, and how these can be manipulated using pointers. Your inputs will influence the course of the journey, making it a personalized experience.
